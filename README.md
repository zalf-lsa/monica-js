**JavaScript port of MONICA model (still experimental, proof-of-concept)**

"_MONICA is a dynamic, process-based simulation model which describes transport and bio-chemical turn-over of carbon, nitrogen and water in agro-ecosystems. On daily time steps the most important processes in soil and plant are modelled mechanistically. They are linked in such way that feed-back relations of the single processes are reproduced as close to nature as possible. MONICA works one dimensional and represents a space of 1 m² surface area and 2 m depth.
The acronym MONICA is derived from „Model of Nitrogen and Carbon dynamics in Agro-ecosystems”._"

A test GUI is available at [http://zalf-rpm.github.io/monica-js](http://zalf-rpm.github.io/monica-js/). It seems to work with most browsers, however, using Chrome is recommended.
